            Does Freshclass help me get a job?
        </span><br>
        <p class="answer">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freshclass is a training & skilling program that gives students in-classroom
            training & a guaranteed internship at the
            end of the program so students build their profile & become ready for placement opportunities.

            Freshclass will arrange for placement opportunities at the end of the program within Freshworks & outside
            showcasing
            the proof-of-work done during the classroom training & during internships.

            What is expected of me during the Freshclass programme?
        </span><br>
        <p class="answer">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once students clear the admission process & become part of the Software
            Academy program, we expect them to
            maintain a high degree of commitment, motivation and hard work, throughout their association with FWSA.
            We evaluate the students through attendance % and monthly performances. If a student lacks
            attendance/performance consistently for 3 months in a row, in spite of multiple interventions &
            communication,
            they might not be allowed to continue with the Freshclass program.

        <p class="answer">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Not a degree, but a certificate of course completion & internship
            experience will be provided followed by a job
            interview at Freshworks & partnering organizations.

            Will I be tied to any bond?

        <p class="answer">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            No, students donâ€™t sign any bond. That being said, they do sign a
            contract for basic classroom ethics and
            eventually, the Freshworks Internship <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/company/philanthropy/software-academy/terms-conditions/">Terms & Conditions</a>.
